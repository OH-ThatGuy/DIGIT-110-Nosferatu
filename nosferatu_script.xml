                    squats on the floor opposite the animal and plays with it. Her dressing gown

                    him back again to confess that she hasn't got any money left to do the shopping.
                    He pulls out his purse with a sad look and holds it up: there is nothing in it!
                    They both sigh. He leaves with a heavy heart. The moment she is alone she takes
                    a small basket of potatoes, which is all she can find, the last resort of the
                    poor house-wife, and starts peeling them. A potato drops on the floor, the

                    haste? Isn't it Hutter? He grasps the passing man by his sleeve; he holds on to
                    it. Hutter greets him, looking pleased. Bulwer laughs and looking deep into his
                    eyes says:</dir>

                    with a laugh and rushes off. Bulwer stands there for a moment, then he resumes

                    Somewhere in the distance a fire place. Flanked by two armoured figures. Black
                    and motionless. In older times this must have been used by knights for their
                    drinking bouts. Are these their armour? Is that long line that runs across the
                    wall a crack in the old structure? Or a lance left hanging there? Suddenly,
                    Hutter notices that the count is waiting. Quickly he hands him the plans of the
                    deserted house and Knock's letters. With a smile Orlok takes them and begs him
                    to take a seat. The meal is waiting. Hutter sits down. Orlok lifts up the papers
                    and studies them.</dir>

                    Must have been mosquitoes. A mirror! His bag is nearby on the floor. He takes

                    jumps up. He raises himself to his full height with triumphant determination and
                    a glazed look in his eyes, and says, anticipating the horrors to come with

                    The old book from the inn. Did the inn-keepers wife put it there? Mechanically,

                    jerks himself up. He looks about in amazement. He clutches his heart. The
                    bestial tenseness of his bearing relaxes. For a moment he stands, legs apart, as
                    if trying to regain his balance. He clutches his heart again and falls on his
                    knees, his face turned to the sun, distorted by pain.</dir>
