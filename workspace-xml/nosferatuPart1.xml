               Ellen, by the window, is pulling the thread with the ball, the cat follows it with a

               the window sill bathed in sunshine and looks out dreamily. She squats on the floor
               opposite the animal and plays with it. Her dressing gown moves in the breeze, her big

               into the sauce pan holds it upside down indicating that it is empty, and looks at her
               reproachfully.</dir>  <title>Ellen!</title>
            <dir type="char">She is sulking now and trying to placate him. But he pulls out his

               back again to confess that she hasn't got any money left to do the shopping. He pulls
               out his purse with a sad look and holds it up: there is nothing in it! They both
               sigh. He leaves with a heavy heart. The moment she is alone she takes a small basket
               of potatoes, which is all she can find, the last resort of the poor house-wife, and
               starts peeling them. A potato drops on the floor, the kitten comes up and plays with

               Suddenly he stops and turns around. Who is following him in such haste? Isn't it
               Hutter? He grasps the passing man by his sleeve; he holds on to it. Hutter greets
               him, looking pleased. Bulwer laughs and looking deep into his eyes says:</dir>

            <dir type="char">Hutter, of course, doesn't understand him. He has to get to office

               funeral cloth. Their eyes like pointed stars. Puffs of steam from their open mouths,

            <dir type="char">Why should he worry about a few little spots? he thinks and puts the
               mirror away. He yawns once more. But suddenly he stops. What's this? He looks at the
               table, astonished.</dir>

            <dir type="char">Still eating, Hutter steps out into the sunlight. He looks around,
               seeming relaxed. He holds a sheet of paper and a pencil in his hands. Then he casts
               about for a suit- able place and, leaning against the stone wall He begins to write a
               letter.</dir>

            <dir type="char"> Hutter stands upright, looking at the clouds. Why does that stupid
               mosquito buzzing around his nose stop him from concentrating? He catches it quickly.
               And now he knows how to continue. He puts pencil to paper again.</dir>

            <dir type="char">Orlok is sitting by the fireplace bent over some plans. Hutter is
               standing behind him. Orlok shows more interest in the young man than in the papers
               lying in front of him. Looking over his shoulder he asks for some more information.
               Hutter rummages among the papers in his bag. A little picture falls on the table. He
               wants to hide it quickly, yet Orlok was quicker. He has picked it up and is looking
               at it.</dir>

            <dir type="char">Orlok's eyes open wide. His lips look even thinner than before.
               Contemplating the picture he whispers:</dir>  <title>What a beautiful throat
               your wife has...</title>
            <cam>Medium close-up:</cam>
            <dir type="char">Hutter is breathing hard. The fear which grips him in the count's
               presence is replaced by a sudden fear for his wife. He forgets himself and reaches for the miniature. 
               For the first time he touches Orlok's body. The count jumps
               up. He raises himself to his full height with triumphant determination and a glazed
               look in his eyes, and says, anticipating the horrors to come with pleasure.</dir>

            <dir type="char">Quickly, he takes up the contract and signs it. He hands it back to
               Hutter. Hutter bows uneasily and retires. Orlok watches him go, a satanic look has
               come into his eyes. His hands have turned into claws. Hutter takes his bag with
               him</dir>

            <dir type="char">Hutter is standing in the middle of the room, quite dazed. He shakes
               off his misgivings. He decides to leave tomorrow. He kisses the picture and starts
               to undress, when to his amazement he discovers a book in his pocket. The old book
               from the inn. Did the inn-keepers wife put it there? Mechanically, he opens it.</dir>

            <dir type="char">Hutter shuts the book. A horrible thought has occurred to him. He is
               feverish. Is it this book, these ancient walls which make him believe in the
               existence of ghosts? Did not the count seem to have vampire-like claws and rat's
               teeth. He jumps up, first running, the sneaking to the door.</dir>
