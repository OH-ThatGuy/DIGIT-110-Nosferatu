               There are flowers in green window-boxes. On the window sill a kitten
               is playing in the morning sun. With graceful movements she tries to catch a ball
               that dangles from a thread. Now the ball is being pulled in through the window.
               The cat jumps in af ter it.

               The morning sun casts the shadow of a window frame onto the floor.
               Ellen, by the window, is pulling the thread with the ball, the cat follows it
               with a leap. Then she puts the little animal on her arm. Playing with it she
               sits down on the window sill bathed in sunshine and looks out dreamily. She
               squats on the floor opposite the animal and plays with it. Her dressing gown
               moves in the breeze, her big child-like eyes a laughing.

               is standing in front of the mirror. He is about to put his jack- et on. He
               pauses to listen, takes a look through the side window. Smiling happily he
               finishes dressing and goes out.

               a quick gesture and makes a bouquet.

               up.
               <span class="cam">Shot of cooker</span>
               Ellen comes over and begins to busy herself with the sauce pans,
               with a childlike earnestness towards her house-wifely duties.
               <span class="cam">Shot of door:</span>
               Hutter is standing in the doorway and laughs and laughs. Hiding the
               bouquet behind his back, he laughs and laughs
               <span class="cam">Shot of cooker</span>
               Ellen turns around, catches sight of her husband and seems a little
               ashamed that she hasn't yet made breakfast. Now Hutter moves closer to her,
               looks into the sauce pan holds it upside down indicating that it is empty, and
               looks at her reproachfully.
               Ellen!
               She is sulking now and trying to placate him. But he pulls out his
               watch; it is late already; he has to go. He kisses her good-bye, but she calls
               him back again to confess that she hasn't got any money left to do the shopping.
               He pulls out his purse with a sad look and holds it up: there is nothing in it!
               They both sigh. He leaves with a heavy heart. The moment she is alone she takes
               a small basket of potatoes, which is all she can find, the last resort of the
               poor house-wife, and starts peeling them. A potato drops on the floor, the
               kitten comes up and plays with it.

               They are rushing towards each other, Ellen throws herself into

               He produces the bouquet, hands it to her beaming all over his face.
               She is touched then, saddening, she takes the glowers looking at the stems and
               stroking them. His voice asks for the reasons of her behavior she says:
               Why have you killed them ... the beautiful flowers?
               Hutter is taken aback for a moment. He apologizes and kisses her.
               Then she forgives him, they stand in an embrace.

               Professor Bulwer is walking vigorously, yet slowly along the road,
               enjoying the morning and the sunshine. His stick strikes the ground
               energetically. Suddenly he stops and turns around. Who is following him in such
               haste? Isn't it Hutter? He grasps the passing man by his sleeve; he holds on to
               it. Hutter greets him, looking pleased. Bulwer laughs and looking deep into his
               eyes says:
               Why so hasty , my young friend? One reaches one's goal soon enough.
               Hutter, of course, doesn't understand him. He has to get to office
               quickly. He greets him again and again. Until he manages at last to break free
               with a laugh and rushes off. Bulwer stands there for a moment, then he resumes
               the regular rhythm of his walk.

               Pale light is falling through tiny blind window-panes into the
               strange room which is eccentrically decorated with bits of old-fashioned
               furniture. KNOCK is standing at a high desk. People call him a house

               Knock's spindly hunch-backed figure. Grey hair, weather- beaten
               face full of wrinkles. Around his mouth throbs the ugly tic of the epileptic. In
               his eyes burns a sombre fire. He is reading a letter.

               He wants a handsome deserted house.
               <span class="cam">Long shot</span>
               For a moment Knock is lost in thought, then he has an idea. He

               waves to him. Her face lights up with joy. She hurries over to the door.
               Presently Hutter enters. Moved and happy, he puts his arms around her and tells

               I shall go on a journey far far away to the country of mountains where there
               are bandits and ghosts still.
                Ellen is startled. A shadow passes over her forehead. She wants to
               hold him back. But he is not listening. He has got to pack; already he is

               says:

                At first they are all startled by these words. Then Hutter breaks

               The ground falls away towards the back. Night mists are creeping up
               from the valley. The horses are put out here to graze. Suddenly, they raise
               their heads, as if frightened and, scattering, gallop away.

               The passengers, seen from behind are standing by the win- dow,
               looking out apprehensively. The old servant has not go the courage to go up to
               where they stand and makes the sign of the cross. Hutter stands alone, looking
               around. He is perplexed and wants to ask what is happening. The old servant
               comes up to him and whispers into his ear.
               You mustn't go there now there are wolves about Spend the night here.
               Hutter understands and decides to stay.

               without a word. Her eyes expressing concern for him. Hutter alone. He goes over
               to the window, throws it open and looks into the starless night.

               Hutter, shaking his head, continues reading Book:...grown up on his

               Hutter shuts the book, having lost interest. It seems confused to

               Yawning like someone who has slept deeply but not well. He sits up rubbing his

               spits on the floor in contempt of the confused rubbish and throws

               have got into the coach. Now, in the morning light, one can see their
               differences. They are much less uni- form than they had seemed the previous
               nightfall. They are chattering noisily to the people who are staying be- hind
               and with the peasants and nosy children who are gathered around the coach.

               castle? and gets into the middle of the road to warn them off. The mail coach
               stops. Hutter gets off the coach box. Now he stands at the crossroad. The

               moved by a hidden force and moving jerkily. Stops dead. Hutter likewise. A black
               carriage. No wheels? Two black horses - griffins? Their legs are invisible,
               covered by a black funeral cloth. Their eyes like pointed stars. Puffs of steam
               from their open mouths, re- vealing white teeth. The coachman is wrapped up in
               black cloth. His face pale as death. His eyes are staring at Hutter. Raising his
               whip he makes an inviting, almost commanding gesture. He waits. Hutter cannot r
               ally enough strength to follow the invitation. Yet those eyes assert their
               power. Step by step, as if pulled by invisible threads, Hutter approaches the
               uncanny creature. He gets into the carriage. It reverses quick as lightning,
               dashes off a disappears.

               Hutter staring into space as if transfixed. After the twelfth
               stroke he drops his knife and fork. The knife grazes his hand, it is
               bleeding.
               <span class="cam">Medium Close-up</span>
               Quick as lightning the count rushes up to him offering his help. He
               prevents Hutter from wiping off the blood. The knife might have been poisoned
               The sticky blood should be removed from the cut. His lips are sucking at the
               hand hastily. Frightened, Hutter pulls away his hand from his grip. He moves
               backwards towards the fireplace.

               By the fireplace. The Count is polite; he has lost his ghostlike
               appearance. He is asking for something in a friendly, almost sad manner.
               Shall we stay up together for a little while? It's a long time to go till
               sunrise . . . And during the day I am always out and about.
               The Count sits down. And Hutter cannot resist his chivalrous
               manner. He sinks back into the massive chair.

               empty. But there is light on it. Hutter's gaze wanders across the hall over to
               the window.

               remembers a few more things. What has he got on his neck? He touches his throat.
               Must have been mosquitoes. A mirror! His bag is nearby on the floor. He takes
               out his mirror and looks at his neck.

               casts about for a suit- able place and, leaning against the stone wall He begins
               to write a letter.

               Orlok is sitting by the fireplace bent over some plans. Hutter is
               standing behind him. Orlok shows more interest in the young man than in the
               papers lying in front of him. Looking over his shoulder he asks for some more
               information. Hutter rummages among the papers in his bag. A little picture falls
               on the table. He wants to hide it quickly, yet Orlok was quicker. He has picked
               it up and is looking at it.

               Orlok's eyes open wide. His lips look even thinner than before.
               Contemplating the picture he whispers:
               What a beautiful throat your wife has...
               <span class="cam">Medium close-up:</span>
               Hutter is breathing hard. The fear which grips him in the count's
               presence is replaced by a sudden fear for his wife. He forgets himself and
               reaches for the miniature. For the first time he touches Orlok's body. The count
               jumps up. He raises himself to his full height with triumphant determination and
               a glazed look in his eyes, and says, anticipating the horrors to come with
               pleasure.
               I shall buy the house... The handsome deserted house opposite yours.
               Quickly, he takes up the contract and signs it. He hands it back to
               Hutter. Hutter bows uneasily and retires. Orlok watches him go, a satanic look
               has come into his eyes. His hands have turned into claws. Hutter takes his bag

               and starts to undress, when to his amazement he discovers a book in his pocket.
               The old book from the inn. Did the inn-keepers wife put it there? Mechanically,

               existence of ghosts? Did not the count seem to have vampire-like claws and rat's
               teeth. He jumps up, first running, the sneaking to the door.

               lid. He recoils in horror. Dropping the lid, he retreats into the darkest
               corner. For inside the coffin he has seen, black and long, the lifeless body of
               NOSFERATU. Horror-stricken, Hutter almost collapses. Then he rushes out.

               Hutter, dressed, stands in front of his bed. He looks pale and weak
               still, yet full of resolution. The nurse notices his unsteady stance. She fusses
               around him. You ought to stay a few more days! Have some more rest! But he wards
               her off. His gestures are restless and fluttering, a strange force has taken
               possession of him.
                I have to get home by the shortest possible way! !
                So he says goodbye, disregarding the nurse's advice, thanks her
               for her care and goes out quickly.

               second blow. And the same thing happens again: rats! only rats! He is wading
               through wriggling bodies which surround him from all sides. Yet he withstands

                She collapses with exhaustion. Then pulls himself together and

                I will run over quickly . . . I shall get Sievers. And he is
               gone.

               Anny, having almost fainted with fear, comes to again. She opens
               her eyes. She lifts her head. No- body around?? Is she all alone?? Isn't there
               some- thing moving about in the corner? Something fluttering at the window?

               shut. Anny beats against the door. She is waiting for the horror, but she

               covers her head and neck. Then she collapses.

               anticipating the horror about to happen. And it is coming - - slowly, tensed
               like a predatory animal. She recoils, moves backwards step by step, and step
               by step it follows her Heart! - Hand

               Night.
               Ellen in bed, the strangler is at her throat, his fingers clawing
               her arms. Her eyes, widened in mortal fear, have a glazed look. Then she seems
               to have heard something.

               her arms around him: he cannot resist and bends his head over her again.

               Here eyes light up hopefully and remain fixed on this first sign of

               downwards.

               . Has she sacrificed herself in vain? Suddenly the horrible figure
               jerks himself up. He looks about in amazement. He clutches his heart. The
               bestial tenseness of his bearing relaxes. For a moment he stands, legs apart, as
               if trying to regain his balance. He clutches his heart again and falls on his
               knees, his face turned to the sun, distorted by pain.

               the light that brings him death. But he cannot hold out against the sun. His
               fingers, his hand, his arm are dissolving in the light. The sun seems about to
               strike his heart. Now his body is dis- integrating in the light. Ellen throws up
               her hands triumphantly calling:
                Hutter!
