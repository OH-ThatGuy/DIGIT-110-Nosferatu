Below deck.  There are the black boxes. They are the man's target. He 

   lifts his axe at the first one and shatters its lid. There it is:

   He is tempted to retreat.

   Rats! All round his ankles he feels the crawling of horrible

   creatures. Yet he pulls himself together for a second time.

   Another box, smashed by a second blow. And the same

   thing happens again: rats! only rats! He is wading through 

   wriggling bodies which surround him from all sides. Yet he 

   withstands the horror. There, a third box.

Close-up:  The mate. In despair, foaming at the lips, he prepares for the

   third blow.

Long shot:  The axe falls from his hand. His hair is standing on end.

   Quick as lightning NOSFERATU rears up from the box.

   Now the mate is finally overcome by horror . . . Covering

   his eyes with his hands he runs upstairs, crazy with fear.

   Slowly and steadily, NOSFERATU is approaching.

Fade-in.

On deck   The captain is guarding the helm. Then from the hatch, the 

   mate emerges . . . his hair has turned grey . . . his face looks

   crazed . . . he is foaming at the mouth . . trying to escape. . . 

   he sways . . .turns deliriously in a circle . . .loses his sense of

   direction. . .does not see the railing. . . and overshoots it.

   Falling head first.

   The captain watches in horror. Now he is lef t all alone. But his

   face remains determined. He picks up a rope and ties himself to

   the helm, not to be tempted to leave. Thus he awaits the horror. . .

Anny's room.  Night. Anny is asleep.

   The storm is pushing against the windows, opening them. The

   curtain is billowing and fluttering in the wind. Anny wakes up.

   Confused, Terrified, she jumps up. She tries to shut the win-

   dow, yet cannot bring herself to do it. The storm is pushing

   her back . . . she recoils. She runs out of the room.
