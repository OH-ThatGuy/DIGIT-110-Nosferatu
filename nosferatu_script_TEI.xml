                <stage>There are flowers in green window-boxes. On the window sill a kitten
                    is playing in the morning sun. With graceful movements she tries to catch a ball
                    that dangles from a thread. Now the ball is being pulled in through the window.

                    Ellen, by the window, is pulling the thread with the ball, the cat follows it
                    with a leap. Then she puts the little animal on her arm. Playing with it she
                    sits down on the window sill bathed in sunshine and looks out dreamily. She
                    squats on the floor opposite the animal and plays with it. Her dressing gown
                    moves in the breeze, her big child-like eyes a laughing.</stage>

                <stage>Ellen turns around, catches sight of her husband and seems a little
                    ashamed that she hasn't yet made breakfast. Now Hutter moves closer to her,
                    looks into the sauce pan holds it upside down indicating that it is empty, and
                    looks at her reproachfully.</stage>

                <stage>She is sulking now and trying to placate him. But he pulls out his
                    watch; it is late already; he has to go. He kisses her good-bye, but she calls
                    him back again to confess that she hasn't got any money left to do the shopping.
                    He pulls out his purse with a sad look and holds it up: there is nothing in it!
                    They both sigh. He leaves with a heavy heart. The moment she is alone she takes
                    a small basket of potatoes, which is all she can find, the last resort of the
                    poor house-wife, and starts peeling them. A potato drops on the floor, the
                    kitten comes up and plays with it.</stage>

                    She is touched then, saddening, she takes the glowers looking at the stems and
                    stroking them. His voice asks for the reasons of her behavior she says:</stage>
                <caption>Why have you killed them ... the beautiful flowers?</caption>
                <stage>Hutter is taken aback for a moment. He apologizes and kisses her.

                    enjoying the morning and the sunshine. His stick strikes the ground
                    energetically. Suddenly he stops and turns around. Who is following him in such
                    haste? Isn't it Hutter? He grasps the passing man by his sleeve; he holds on to
                    it. Hutter greets him, looking pleased. Bulwer laughs and looking deep into his
                    eyes says:</stage>
                <caption>Why so hasty , my young friend? One reaches one's goal soon enough.</caption>
                <stage>Hutter, of course, doesn't understand him. He has to get to office
                    quickly. He greets him again and again. Until he manages at last to break free
                    with a laugh and rushes off. Bulwer stands there for a moment, then he resumes

                    down right in front. At once the old servant approaches with a glass and puts it
                    down in front of him. He overcomes a strange anxiety that was brought on by the
                    evening mood in a strange country and puts on a sudden show of liveliness. He
                    knocks on the table and says:</stage>

                    from their open mouths, re- vealing white teeth. The coachman is wrapped up in

                    Somewhere in the distance a fire place. Flanked by two armoured figures. Black
                    and motionless. In older times this must have been used by knights for their
                    drinking bouts. Are these their armour? Is that long line that runs across the
                    wall a crack in the old structure? Or a lance left hanging there? Suddenly,
                    Hutter notices that the count is waiting. Quickly he hands him the plans of the
                    deserted house and Knock's letters. With a smile Orlok takes them and begs him
                    to take a seat. The meal is waiting. Hutter sits down. Orlok lifts up the papers

                    Must have been mosquitoes. A mirror! His bag is nearby on the floor. He takes

                    on the table. He wants to hide it quickly, yet Orlok was quicker. He has picked

                    jumps up. He raises himself to his full height with triumphant determination and
                    a glazed look in his eyes, and says, anticipating the horrors to come with
