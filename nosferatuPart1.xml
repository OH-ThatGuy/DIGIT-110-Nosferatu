Outside a window   There are flowers in green window-boxes.  On the 

    window sill a kitten is playing in the morning sun. 

    With graceful movements she tries to catch a ball 

    that dangles from a thread.  Now the ball is being 

    pulled in through the window.  The cat jumps in

    af ter it.

Small neat kitchen   The morning sun casts the shadow of a window 

    frame onto the floor.  Ellen, by the window, is 

    pulling the thread with the ball, the cat follows it 

    with a leap.  Then she puts the little animal on her 

    arm. 
Playing with it she sits down on the window      
    sill bathed in sunshine and looks out dreamily. 

    She squats on the floor opposite the animal and 

    plays with it. Her dressing gown moves in the breeze, 

    her big  child-like eyes a laughing.

A small sitting room (attic)  Poor-looking and tidy. A bed, a chair in the

    period style.  Hutter is standing in front

    of the mirror.  He is about to put his jack-

    et on.  He pauses to listen, takes a look 

    through the side window. Smiling happily

    he finishes dressing and goes out.

Shot from above. Hutter appears, gardening 
    knife in hand, looks up  front of Hutter's house  

    beaming with joy. He finds a clump of carn-

    and makes a bouquet.

<scene num="5">
The small kitchen   Ellen, still playing with the kitten, hears Hutter  

    coming and jumps up.

Shot of cooker  Ellen comes over and begins to busy herself with 

   the sauce pans, with a childlike earnestness towards 

   her house-wifely duties.

Shot of door:  Hutter is standing in the doorway and laughs and laughs.

   
Hiding the bouquet behind his back, he laughs and laughs
Shot of cooker  Ellen turns around, catches sight of her husband 

   and seems a little ashamed that she hasn't yet made 

   breakfast.  Now Hutter moves closer to her, looks 

   into the sauce pan holds it upside down indicating 

   that it is empty, and looks at her reproachfully.

Title:   Ellen!

   
She is sulking now and trying to placate him. But 
   he pulls out his watch; it is late already; he has to go.  

   He kisses her good-bye, but she calls him back again 

   to confess that she hasn't got any money left to do 

   the shopping.  He pulls out his purse with a sad look 

   and holds it up: there is nothing in it!  They both sigh.  

   He leaves with a heavy heart.  The moment she is

   alone she takes a small basket of potatoes, which  

   is all she can find, the last resort of the poor

   house-wife, and starts peeling them.  A potato 

   drops on the floor, the kitten comes up and

    plays with it.

Fade-out   They are rushing towards each other, Ellen throws 

   herself into Hutter's arms

Long Shot  He produces the bouquet, hands it to her beaming 

   all over his face. She is touched then, saddening, 

   she takes the glowers looking at the stems and 

   stroking them.  His voice asks for the reasons of her 

   behavior she says:

Title   Why have you killed them ...

   the beautiful flowers?

   Hutter is taken aback for a moment. He apologizes 

   and kisses her.

   Then she forgives him, they stand in an embrace.

Street with front gardens  

Title:   Professor Bulwer

   Professor Bulwer is walking vigorously, yet slowly along the road, enjoying the morning

   and the sunshine.  His stick strikes the ground energetically.

   Suddenly he stops and turns around. Who is following him in such haste? Isn't it Hutter?

   He grasps the passing man by his sleeve; he holds on to it.  Hutter greets him,

   looking pleased.  Bulwer laughs and looking deep into his eyes says:

Title:   Why so hasty , my young friend?  One 

   reaches one's goal soon enough.

   

   

   Hutter, of course, doesn't understand him.  He has to get 

   to office quickly.  He greets him again and again.  Until he 

   manages at last to break free with a laugh and rushes off.  

   Bulwer stands there for a moment, then he resumes the 

   regular rhythm of his walk.

Fade-in

Dusty cramped office Pale light is falling through tiny blind window-panes 

   into the strange room which is eccentrically 

   decorated with bits of old-fashioned furniture.

   KNOCK is standing at a high desk. People

   call him a house agent.

Close-up   Knock's spindly hunch-backed figure.  Grey hair, weather-

   beaten face full of wrinkles.  Around his mouth throbs the 

   ugly tic of the epileptic. In his eyes burns a sombre fire.  

   He is reading a letter.

Close-up   The letter.  On a sheet of paper decorated on the margin 

   with grotesque vignettes a medley of intricate and quite ill-

   egible signs.

Med. Close-up  Knock seems to be able to make sense of the strange letter,

   for his ugly mouth sets into an understanding smile.  Then 

   he turns and opens the door.

   Town

 
Close-up   Knock's demonic face with wide open eyes

Title   You could make a nice bit of money . . .

   It will take some effort, however . . .

   a few drops of sweat and blood. . .

   Perhaps a little blood

Closeup   In Hutter's face expressions of mounting joy and

   strange apprehension are fighting each other.

   Yet joy wins in the end.

  

Long shot  Knock digs up and old atlas from the depths

   of the cabinet and opens it. His finger runs

   over a page.

Closeup   The route from England to Transyvania on

   the map.

Long shot  Transylvania? asks Hutter, his eyes suddenly shin-

   ing at the thought of a journey.  Yet Knock has

   turned back to the letter, now reading the 

   last page.

Closeup   The back page of the letter, covered with the

   same illegible squiggles.

Long shot  Knock seems to be able to make sense of this 

   page too.  He turns back to Hutter who is al-

   ready day-dreaming about his journey.

Title   He wants a handsome deserted house.

Long shot  For a moment Knock is lost in thought, then he 

   has an idea.  He limps over to the window.

   her his great news:

Title   I shall go on a journey far far away

   to the country of mountains where

   there are bandits and ghosts still.

   But he rejects her remonstrations.  Now he

   has finished packing.  He gets up.  Ellen

   realizing that he has made up his mind steps

   back, resigning herself.  But there is fear

   Harding promises his friend to look after Ellen,

Long shot of

all characters  Hutter gives his hand to Anny and then to Ellen

   One last farewell kiss. At this moment her grief

   is over.  As if she had a premonition she says:

Title   Farewell!  There is no escape left.

   At first they are all startled by these words.  

   Then Hutter breaks away.  Another farewell, another 

   wave of the hand and Hutter vanishes into the park.

   down in front of him.  He overcomes a strange anxiety

   that was brought on by the evening mood in a

   strange country and puts on a sudden show of 

   liveliness. He knocks on the table and says:

Title   Quickly, my meal -

   gathered around the coach.

   left hanging there? Suddenly, Hutter notices that the count

   is waiting. Quickly he hands him the plans of the deserted

Close-up   Hutter eating. He puts a morsel into his mouth. He lifts

   up his eyes. His look turns into a stare. He is unable to swallow

Long shot  The hall with the halo of light in the center; the

   figures are looming above the table.

Close-up   An antique clock with a pendulum. A hammer 

   strikes the hour. The big hand points to 12

   o'clock.

Medium close-up:  Hutter staring into space as if transfixed. After

    the twelfth stroke he drops his knife and fork. 

    The knife grazes his hand, it is bleeding.

Medium Close-up  Quick as lightning the count rushes up to him 

   offering his help. He prevents Hutter from wiping 

   off the blood. The knife might have been poisoned

   The sticky blood should be removed from the cut.

   His lips are sucking at the hand hastily. Frightened,

   Hutter pulls away his hand from his grip. He moves

   backwards 
towards the fireplace.
Medium Close-up  By the fireplace. The Count is polite; he has lost 

   his ghostlike appearance. He is asking for something 

   in a friendly, almost sad manner.

Title   Shall we stay up together

   for a little while? It's a

   long time to go till sunrise . . .

   And during the day I am always 

   out and about.

   The Count sits down. And Hutter cannot resist

   his chivalrous manner. He sinks back into the

   massive chair.

The same hall  Hutter wakes up in the large armchair near the

   fireplace. He can hardly remember the events of 

   the night. The armchair opposite seems to be 

   empty. But there is light on it. Hutter's gaze wanders

   across the hall over to the window.

Shot of window  It is very high and divided up into small panes. 

   Morning light is streaming in.

Shot as before  An old-fashioned window. An ancient hall, very dusty.

   Nothing strange about it. Hutter yawns. His eyes 

   fall on the cut in his hand and he remembers

   a few more things. What has he got on his neck? 

   He touches his throat. Must have been mosquitoes. 

   A mirror! His bag is nearby on the floor. He takes 

   out his mirror and looks at his neck.

Close-up   The mirror shows two red spots on his neck, 

   very close together.

Normal close-up  Why should he worry about a few little spots? he

   thinks and puts the mirror away. He yawns once

   more. But suddenly he stops. What's this? He looks

   at the table, astonished. 

   

Close up:  A still-life of food: fruit, a joint, all kinds

    of gastronomic delicacies.

Normal:   He is overjoyed. He rushes over to the table and begins 

   to eat as if he were starved.

The dilapidated terrace Still eating, Hutter steps out into the sunlight. He looks

   around, seeming relaxed. He holds a sheet of paper

   and a pencil in his hands. Then he casts about for a suit-

   able place and, leaning against the stone wall He begins

   to write a letter.

Close-up:  The beginning of the letter: My dearest, my only one. . .

Normal:   Hutter stands upright, looking at the clouds. Why does

   that stupid mosquito buzzing around his nose stop him

   from concentrating? He catches it quickly. And now he 

   knows how to continue. He puts pencil to paper again.

Close-up:   Part of the letter:...the mosquitoes are a real pest. I have

   been stung at the next by two at once, very close to-

   gether, one on each side...

Long shot:  Hutter keeps writing

Forest near the castle A man on horseback is approaching. He stops occasionally

   and peers over to the castle as if he were scared of it.

Outside the porch: Hutter stands there, waving with the letter. The rider comes

   up cautiously and takes the letter without dismounting

   The he dashes off at a gallop showing signs of great fear.

Fade-in.

Dining room  Orlok is sitting by the fireplace bent over some plans.

   Hutter is standing behind him. Orlok shows more 

   interest in the young man than in the papers lying

   in front of him. Looking over his shoulder he asks for 

   some more information. Hutter rummages among

   the papers in his bag. A little picture falls on the table.

   He wants to hide it quickly, yet Orlok was quicker. He has

   picked it up and is looking at it.

Close up   A miniature portrait of Ellen.

Medium close-up  Orlock asks about the person in the picture. And Hutter

   is forced to answer him.

Close up:  Orlok's eyes open wide. His lips look even thinner than

   before. Contemplating the picture he whispers:

Title   What a beautiful throat your wife has...

Medium close-up:  Hutter is breathing hard. The fear which grips 

   him in the count's presence is replaced by a sud-

   den fear for his wife. He forgets himself and rea-

   ches for the miniature. For the first time he 

   touches Orlok's body. The count jumps up. He 

   raises himself to his full height with triumphant

   determination and a glazed look in his eyes, and 

   says, anticipating the horrors to come with pleasure.

Title   I shall buy the house...

   The handsome deserted

   house opposite yours.

   Quickly, he takes up the contract and signs it. He

   hands it back to Hutter. Hutter bows uneasily and

   retires.  Orlok watches him go, a satanic look has

   come into his eyes. His hands have turned into

   claws.

Candle is burning
A small room in castle Hutter is standing in the middle of the room, 

   quite dazed. He shakes off his misgivings. He de-

   cides to leave tomorrow. He kisses the picture

   and starts to undress, when to his amazement

   he discovers a book in his pocket. The old book

   from the inn. Did the in-keepers wife put it there? 

   Mechanically, he opens it.
   Close-up:  The book
   
   Chapter II
   
   Night is the vampire's element.
   
   He can see in the dark
   
   which is a wonderful ability to have in this world
   
   half of which is night.
   
   We humans, however, are helpless and blind at night
   
   Normal   Hutter shuts the book. A horrible thought has 
   
   occurred to him. He is feverish. Is it this book, 
   
   these ancient walls which make him believe in
   
   the existence of ghosts? Did not the count seem
   
   to have vampire-like claws and rat's teeth. He
   
   jumps up, first running, the sneaking to the door.
