# OH: this is still obviously heavily WIP so if anyone has any questions or wants to make changes thats fine

# ebb: Suggestions for markup: Can you distinguish what we read on the screen from description that we don't read? 
# This would include:
# information about camera distance / shots
# Director's notes
# title cards that label + describe
# cards that contain dialogue : which characters are speaking?

# In the <title> descriptions: **what characters are mentioned**
# <descript>.....<char who="ellen">Ellen</char> walks in.

# OH 10/30: Consider adding the following elements to schema in the future, all element names are subject to change, nothing here is final, if you hate it, that's ok
# location(loc), used to establish where the scene takes place
# intertitles(inTitle), not 100% but Dr. B mentioned these
# title(title) use this for the spoken title cards maybe
# camera element (cam), under the cam element we can use attributes to describe camera movement i.e. <cam dis="8 meters">
# distance(dis) <cam dis="8 meters" exp="2x">, distance would be how far the camera is and/or the shot takes place from
# exposure(exp) <cam exp="2x">, we need to look into this, not entirely sure what 2x or 4x is meant to convey
# costume(cost) or outfit(out), self explanatory
# time(time), used at various points in the script to denote daylight or night time
